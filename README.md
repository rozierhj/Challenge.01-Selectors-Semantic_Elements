# Challenge.01 CSS Selectors and Semantic Elements 

## Description

This was a project to help you get acquainted with one half of the possible coding work that can be done on a job, making edits to existing code. The primary purpose was to take existing CSS code and make it both more efficient (removing or combining selectors or other code where possible) and clearer (adding comments, replacing non-semantic elements with semantic elements and changing the order in the CSS where possible). The project was a great lesson on selector specificity. while trying to combine, remove or simplify selectors the developer had to be continually aware and demonstrate an understanding of which selectors had greater specificity and which ones were leading to redundant styling that could be combined into a single selector. The project also focused on using semantic elements. Non-semantic elements were replaced with semantic ones to make the code clearer to other developers, more optimized for search engines and to make the web page more accessible to users using assistive technology when viewing it.
