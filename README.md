# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This was a project to help you get acquainted with on one half of the possible coding work that can be done on a job, making edits to existing code. The primary purpose was to take existing CSS code and make it both more efficient (removing or combining selectors or other code where possible) and clearer (adding comments and changing structure where possible). The project was a great lesson on selector specificity. while trying to combine, remove or simplify selectors the coder had to be continually aware and demonstrate an understanding of which selectors had greater specificity and which ones were leading to redundant styling that could be combined in a single selector.
